          Grammy & Oscar winner A R Rahman to perform his full-fledged Live
          Concert for Feeding Smiles in Pune!

          AR Rahman is a name that needs no introduction to Indian music fans.
          To call him just a musician or composer would do his impact and legacy
          no justice. Experience the Maestro’s Live Concert for Feeding Smiles
          in Pune on 30th April 2023.

            few things to keep in mind though, children up to the age of 3 years

            above that age will require a ticket. Due to the live band
